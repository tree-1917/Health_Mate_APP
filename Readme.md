# Health Root Project 🌱

## Overview 🌟

**Health Root** is a modular, containerized project designed to serve a React UI, APIs, and static files efficiently. It leverages Docker 🐳 and NGINX for seamless deployment and scalability. The project consists of:

- **React UI**: The frontend interface, located in the `ui_service` directory. 🎨
- **Node.js Services**: Backend services for various APIs, located in the `node_service` directory. 🖥️
- **FastAPI Services**: Additional backend services written in Python, located in the `fast_service` directory. 🐍
- **NGINX**: Acts as the static file cache and API gateway for optimized performance. 🚀

## Prerequisites ⚙️

Before you begin, ensure your system has the following installed:

- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) 🐋
- **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 🔧

- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Orchestrates service definitions and interactions. 🔄
- **`Dockerfile`**: Defines the build instructions for the FastAPI service container. 📦
- **`ui_service/`**: Contains all files related to the React UI. 🎨
- **`node_service/`**: Houses the Node.js application files. ⚙️
- **`fast_service/`**: Includes the FastAPI backend implementation. 🐍
- **`nginx.conf`**: Configures NGINX for caching and API routing. 🌐

## Installation and Setup 🛠️

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository 🧑‍💻

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.com:health_mate/health_root.git
cd health_root
```

### 2. Build and Deploy Services 🚀

Use Docker Compose to build and start the application services:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 3. Access the Application 🌍

- **React UI**: Accessible at `http://localhost:3000` 🎨
- **Node.js APIs**: Reachable at `http://localhost:3001` ⚙️
- **FastAPI Services**: Available at `http://localhost:8001` 🐍
- **NGINX Gateway**: Main entry point for the application at `http://localhost` 🌐

## Key Configuration Notes 📝

- **Docker**: Ensure the Docker daemon is running prior to executing commands. 🚚
- **NGINX**: The `nginx.conf` file is preconfigured for:
  - Routing API requests to respective services. 🔀
  - Caching static files for performance. 💨

## Troubleshooting ⚠️

### Common Issues 🛑

1. **Docker Issues**:
   - Verify Docker and Docker Compose are correctly installed and running. 🐋
   - Check service-specific logs using:
     ```bash
     docker-compose logs <service_name>
     ```
     Replace `<service_name>` with the relevant service (e.g., `fast_service`). 🔍

2. **Configuration Errors**:
   - Ensure `nginx.conf` is correctly set up for your environment. 🔧
